== Known Issues

Here we document the known issues.

* Not all Java APIs are supported through the Proxy interface.  Currently, the proxy throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` in
such cases.  We should enter tickets to update the proxy thrift interface to support these additional capabilities.
* We currently need to close the instance which is not part of the public API.  Maybe we should open and close the transport every
time we access the instance so we can open/close the transport each time?  Is there a better way to handle closing the transport
without incurring the overhead of re-establishing the connection on every call?
* Others?
