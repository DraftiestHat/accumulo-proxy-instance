ProxyInstance
=============

This is an implementation of the Accumulo `Instance` Application Programming Interface (API) which uses the Accumulo-supplied, Apache Thrift-based
proxy server as the back-end for communicating with an Accumulo instance.

For more information, see the [Users' Manual](http://jhuapl.github.io/accumulo-proxy-instance/proxy_instance_user_manual.html).
